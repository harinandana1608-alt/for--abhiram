    <h1>For Abhiram ❤️</h1>

    <p>
    From the moment you became a part of my life, everything started to feel a little more beautiful and meaningful.  
    You make ordinary days feel special, and your presence brings so much warmth and happiness into my world.
    </p>

    <p>
    You are my comfort, my safe place, and the person who makes my heart feel at home.  
    Every memory with you is something I treasure, and every moment with you feels right.
    </p>

    <p>
    I’m grateful for your love, your kindness, and the way you make me smile without even trying.  
    Life feels brighter with you in it, and I feel lucky every single day.
    </p>

    <p>
    No matter what the future holds, I know that having you in my life is one of the most beautiful things that has ever happened to me.  
    I look forward to making so many more memories with you.
    </p>

    <p>
    Happy Valentine’s Day, my favorite person 💕
